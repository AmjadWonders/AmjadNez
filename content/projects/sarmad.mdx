## Overview
SARMAD is committed to capturing and preserving memories through innovative design and exceptional user experiences. With a focus on user engagement, visual appeal, and seamless functionality, SARMAD aims to create a website that resonates with its audience and reinforces its brand identity.

## Slogan
**سرمد نخلّد الذكريات** (SARMAD: Immortalizing Memories)

## Development Phases

### Discovery and Planning
Conducted comprehensive research on SARMAD's business model, target audience, and goals. This phase included competitor analysis, market trend evaluation, and assessment of the current website template to define a clear project scope aligned with SARMAD's strategic objectives.

### Design
Overhauled the entire website design to enhance visual appeal and professionalism. This encompassed refining all design elements for a modern appearance, transforming every page to be more engaging and user-friendly, and optimizing image sizes across the site to better showcase the offered services. Additionally, a captivating logo animation was developed to enrich the loading experience and reinforce SARMAD's distinctive brand identity.

### Functionality and User Experience
Implemented a sophisticated filter system for accessories, linked to sub-categories for seamless navigation. Customized the website flow to improve professionalism and user-friendliness. Addressed the minimum items problem in the company-based section, focusing on setting minimum order amounts for specific products.

### Navigation
Strategically designed the navigation bar to be a gateway to key sections, with essential links prominently placed. This ensures users can effortlessly navigate to critical pages, such as products, services, and contact information, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

### Loading Optimization
Focused on optimizing loading times for an efficient and enjoyable user experience. Included a deliberate 5-second force loading on the home page to captivate users' attention, and ensured a maximum of 2 seconds of connection-based loading on other pages for swift transitions without compromising functionality.

### Testing
Conducted thorough testing across a wide range of devices and browsers to ensure flawless functionality. Proactively identified and resolved potential issues prior to the website launch, ensuring a seamless and error-free user experience from the outset.

### Mobile Responsiveness
Optimized the website for mobile responsiveness to cater to the growing number of users accessing the site via mobile devices. Ensured a seamless and visually appealing experience across various screen sizes through responsive design.

### Training and Documentation
Provided training sessions for SARMAD's team on managing and updating the website. Prepared comprehensive documentation outlining processes, troubleshooting steps, and best practices for ongoing maintenance.

## Summary
My approach to redesigning SARMAD's website focused on comprehensive planning, innovative design, enhanced functionality, and rigorous testing to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. By prioritizing mobile responsiveness and offering comprehensive training, I aimed to create a sustainable and inclusive website that aligns with SARMAD's overarching brand identity and mission of immortalizing memories.
